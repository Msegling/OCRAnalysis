# OCRAnalysis
This program uses #Tesseract and #Aforge to compare the #OCR success under various conditions

This project is aimed at contrasting  the success rate of an OCR program, Tesseract, of which a input image has been process by a filter,
that returned the highest mean confidence and a input image of which each word extracted and individually processed by a filter that
returns the highest confidence for the specific word.
